# what can you do with files?
# close: close the file
# read: reads the file
# readline: reads just one line of text
# truncate: Empties the file.. so it's not truncate, it's like Erase
# write('stuff'): Writes into the file
# seek(0): Moves the r/w location to beginning of file.. this is like for HDDs
