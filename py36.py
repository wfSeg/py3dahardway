# don't quit

# every if must have an else
# if the else can't run, then must add a 'die' function - exit(0)
# never nest if-statements two deep... 
# treat if-statements like paragraphs, each elif is like a sentence
# Booleans should be simple, use good names for variables
# if booleans need to be complicated, assign it to a variables earlier in the function

# Rules for loops
# use while-loop only to loop forever, which is probably never
# use for-loop for all other kinds of loops, for fixed or limited cycles

# Debugging
# don't use a debugger. 
# best way to debug is to manually print out values of variables
# make sure parts of the program works, as you're working on it
